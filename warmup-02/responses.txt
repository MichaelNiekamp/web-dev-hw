Why did you decide to take this class?
I am taking this class because I am a computer science major who has not had proper experience with HTML and CSS. My websites are ugly and I know that this class will help me fix that.

What are a few things you hope to learn?
I hope to learn how to build aesthetically pleasing dynamic websites and how to utilize css to its full potential.

Tell us a little about your image file you uploaded.
The image that I uploaded is a picture of my dog Maya. She is a 200 pound english mastiff who is a very sweet dog. She is almost 3 years old.
